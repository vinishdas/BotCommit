A Python bot that uses Hugging Face's `google/gemma-2-2b-it` model to generate code and automatically commits it to a GitHub repository. Perfect for automating daily coding tasks, AI journaling, or creating autonomous agents that evolve over time.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 AI-generated Python code using Hugging Face's `InferenceClient`
- 📂 Automatically saves code with a timestamped filename
- 📌 Git auto commit and push
- ⚙️ Easily configurable for GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

 
## 💻 Local Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
cd YOUR_REPO
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Hugging Face API Key

Export your Hugging Face API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export HF=your_huggingface_api_key
```

### 4. Run the Bot

```bash
python auto_commit_bot.py
```

This will:
- Generate a Python function (e.g., check if a number is a palindrome)
- Save it to a new `.py` file
- Commit and push the file to the current GitHub repository

## 🔁 Automate Using GitHub Actions

### 1. Workflow Setup

Create the following file: `.github/workflows/auto_push.yml`

```yaml
name: Auto Commit Bot

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 12 * * *'  # ⏰ runs every day at 12:00 UTC
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  run-bot:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      contents: write  # ✅ Needed to allow commits via actions

    env:
      HF: ${{ secrets.HF_API_KEY }}
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run the bot
        run: python auto_commit_bot.py
```

### 2. Add Required Secrets

Go to your GitHub repository:

**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

Add the following:

- `HF_API_KEY` → Your Hugging Face API key

No need to add `GITHUB_TOKEN` — it's automatically available in GitHub Actions.

## 📜 Requirements

Add this to your `requirements.txt`:

```
huggingface_hub
```

If you're using a `.env` file, also include:

```
python-dotenv
```

---

## 🧪 Sample Output

Example of a generated code file:

```python
# Auto-generated by GPT

def is_palindrome(n):
    return str(n) == str(n)[::-1]
```

Saved as: `sample_code_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.py`

## 💡 Use Cases

- Daily AI-generated code snippets
- Autonomous GitHub journaling
- Self-learning agents that build their own dataset
- Creative or experimental repositories
